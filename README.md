software, (the "Data & Software"), including 3D meshes, images, videos,
textures, software, scripts, and animations. By downloading and/or using the
Data & Software (including downloading, cloning, installing, and any other use
of the corresponding github repository), you acknowledge that you have read

## Description

**EX**pressive **PO**se and **S**hape r**E**gression (ExPose) is a method
that estimates 3D body pose and shape, hand articulation and facial expression
of a person from a single RGB image. For more details, please see our ECCV paper
[Monocular Expressive Body Regression through Body-Driven Attention](https://expose.is.tue.mpg.de/).
This repository contains:
* A PyTorch demo to run ExPose on images.
* An inference script for the supported datasets.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies run the following command:
```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The code has been tested with two configurations: a) with Python 3.7, CUDA 10.1, CuDNN 7.5 and PyTorch 1.5 on Ubuntu 18.04, and b) with Python 3.6, CUDA 10.2 and PyTorch 1.6 on Ubuntu 18.04. 


### Preparing the data

First, you should head to the [project website](https://expose.is.tue.mpg.de/) and create an account.
If you want to stay informed, please opt-in for email communication 
and we will reach out with any updates on the project.
Once you have your account, login and head to the download section
to get the pre-trained **ExPose** model.
Create a folder named *data* and extract the downloaded zip there.
You should now have a folder with the following structure:
```bash
data
├── checkpoints
├── all_means.pkl
├── conf.yaml
├── shape_mean.npy
├── SMPLX_to_J14.pkl
```
For more information on the data, please read the [data documentation](doc/data.md).
If you don't already have an account on the [SMPL-X website](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/), 
please register to be able to download the model. Afterward, extract the SMPL-X model
zip inside the data folder you created above.
```bash
data
├── models
│   ├── smplx
```
You are now ready to run the demo and inference scripts.

### Demo 

We provide a script to run **ExPose** directly on images. 
To get you started, we provide a sample folder, taken from [pexels](https://pexels.com),
which can be processed with the the following command:
```shell
    python demo.py --image-folder samples \
    --exp-cfg data/conf.yaml \
    --show=False \
    --output-folder OUTPUT_FOLDER \
    --save-params [True/False] \
    --save-vis [True/False] \
    --save-mesh [True/False]
```
The script will use a *Keypoint R-CNN* from *torchvision* to detect people in
the images and then produce a SMPL-X prediction for each using **ExPose**.
You should see the following output for the sample image:

|  ![Sample](samples/man-in-red-crew-neck-sweatshirt-photography-941693.png) | ![HD Overlay](images/hd_overlay.png) | 
| --- | --- |

### Inference

The [inference](inference.py) script can be used to run inference on one of the supported
datasets. For example, if you have a folder with images and OpenPose keypoints
with the following structure:
```bash
folder
├── images
│   ├── img0001.jpg
│   └── img0002.jpg
│   └── img0002.jpg
├── keypoints
│   ├── img0001_keypoints.json
│   └── img0002_keypoints.json
│   └── img0002_keypoints.json
```
Then you can use the following command to run ExPose for each person:
```shell
python inference.py --exp-cfg data/conf.yaml \
           --datasets openpose \
           --exp-opts datasets.body.batch_size B datasets.body.openpose.data_folder folder \
           --show=[True/False] \
           --output-folder OUTPUT_FOLDER \
           --save-params [True/False] \
           --save-vis [True/False] \
           --save-mesh [True/False]
```
You can select if you want to save the estimated parameters, meshes, and renderings by 
setting the corresponding flags.
